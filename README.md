Derek's Hackernews Crap Filter
=========
v0.1 - 14-Aug-2013 - warren@sfu.ca
Initial release.

Manifesto
-
Maybe you like technical news and you already read Slashdot.

Maybe you also like the technical articles that filter through hackernews
(http://news.ycombinator.com) but the absence of an RSS feed makes you grit
your teeth and you're REALLY tired of schmaltz and chaff like this:

- "This is a web page. It is just words. OMG IT'S SO TRUE"
- "Why I'm Leaving Elon Musk"
- "How do I find a technical co-founder?"

No longer.
-

Stick your most hated buzzphrases in hn-verboten.txt, run hn-filter.py and Be Happy.

[Cmd]+Click URLs in Mac OS X Terminal.app to visit URLs.

Requirements
-

- Python 2.7-ish.
- Python modules: BeautifulSoup and Requests


Have a nice day.
