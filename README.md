Derek's Hackernews Crap Filter
==

Manifesto
--

The best filter is to not go to hackernews at all. I quit in 2020 and so should you.

"AI" slop is taking over the web and "AI" playthings have a massive environmental footprint. We are awash in terrible "AI-enabled" products nobody asked for. You do the math. I have never been so ashamed to work in computers before.

Do something better with your time: help people in need, read a book, make art, pet cats.
